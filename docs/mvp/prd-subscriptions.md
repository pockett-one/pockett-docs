## Pricing Strategy

### Tiered Capacity Model

Plans use a **tiered capacity model** (no add-on project packs):
- **Projects included** scale by tier: Standard 10, Pro 25, Business 50, Enterprise 100 (shown in pricing title tile).
- **Active projects** = not closed or archived; unlimited closed projects don't count toward the limit.
- **Unlimited Members**: No per-user charges.
- **Storage**: Unlimited (via Google Drive integration; bring your own Drive, non-custodial).
- Need more than tier capacity: contact for Enterprise/custom.

### Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Base Price | Projects Included | Target Market |
|------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Standard** | $49/month | 10 active projects | Small firms, solo consultants |
| **Pro** | $99/month | 25 active projects | Growing firms needing advanced review & templates |
| **Business** | $149/month | 50 active projects | Established firms, mid-size agencies, automation |
| **Enterprise** | Contact Us | 100 active projects (custom available) | Large organizations, enterprise |

### Payment Gateway Considerations

**Challenge**: Indian founder setup requires trusted global checkout for US/EU/SG/AU customers with tax-friendly invoicing.

**Options:**
1. **Stripe**: Invite-only in India; requires alternative approach
2. **Razorpay**: Indian payment gateway with international support
3. **Paddle**: Merchant of record, handles tax compliance globally
4. **Chargebee + Payment Gateway**: Subscription management with multiple gateway support

**Recommendation**: Evaluate Paddle or Chargebee + Razorpay for international reach and tax compliance.
