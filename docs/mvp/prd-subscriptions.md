- ✅ **Prevent IP Theft: Protect Sensitive Files from Accidental Sharing**: Self-destruct timers, 'Never Share' tags, and persona-based access control that automatically separates what clients see vs internal files. No more worrying about wrong documents reaching wrong clients.
- ✅ **Stop Wasting Time: No More Resharing Links or Fixing Permissions**: Automatic permission management - access stays active, clients always know where to find documents. No more 'can you resend that link?' emails.
- ✅ **End Folder Chaos: Structured Project Organization**: Turn messy Drive folders into clean Client → Project hierarchy that makes sense to clients. Uses your existing Google Drive - no migration needed.
- ✅ **Stop Chasing Feedback: See What Clients Reviewed & When**: See exactly what clients have reviewed, when they accessed documents, and track feedback that stays organized and visible. No more 'did you see the updated proposal?' follow-ups.

- ✅ **One-Click Access Revocation: Lock Projects When Done**: One-click project closure automatically revokes all Drive permissions. Lock client folders to 'View Only' when deliverables are finalized. Clean project handoffs.

## Pricing Strategy

### Capacity-Based Model

All plans use a **capacity-based pricing model**:

- **Add-on Packs**: Purchase additional 10-project packs as needed
- **Unlimited Members**: No per-user charges
- **Storage**: Unlimited (via Google Drive integration)

### Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Base Price | Projects Included | Add-on Pack Price | Target Market |
|------|------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Pro** | $49/month | 10 active projects | $29/month per 10-project pack | Small firms, solo consultants |
| **Pro Plus** | $99/month | 10 active projects | $49/month per 10-project pack | Growing firms needing advanced review |

| **Enterprise** | $299/month | 10 active projects | $99/month per 10-project pack | Large organizations, enterprise |

### Payment Gateway Considerations

**Challenge**: Indian founder setup requires trusted global checkout for US/EU/SG/AU customers with tax-friendly invoicing.

**Options:**
1. **Stripe**: Invite-only in India; requires alternative approach
2. **Razorpay**: Indian payment gateway with international support
3. **Paddle**: Merchant of record, handles tax compliance globally
4. **Chargebee + Payment Gateway**: Subscription management with multiple gateway support

**Recommendation**: Evaluate Paddle or Chargebee + Razorpay for international reach and tax compliance.
