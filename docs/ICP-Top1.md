## Step 1: Framework for First ICP Selection

For a first-time solopreneur Micro-SaaS, the best first ICP is **NOT** the one with the biggest pain. It’s the one with the best combination of factors.

| Dimension | Why it matters |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pain intensity** | They must feel the problem weekly. |
| **Buying autonomy** | One person can say “yes” (no committee). |
| **Low compliance friction** | No audits, no legal reviews, no complex procurement. |
| **Existing tool gaps** | Not already locked into heavy, legacy systems. |
| **Online reachability** | You can talk to them directly (Reddit, FB, X, etc.). |
| **Price tolerance** | Can pay $50–$100/mo without procurement approval. |

## Step 2: Honest ICP-by-ICP Assessment

### 1️⃣ Legal & Law Firms
*   **Pain:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (Critical)
*   **Willingness to pay:** 💰💰💰💰 (High)
*   **Reachability:** ⚠️ Medium
*   **Compliance friction:** ❌ High

**Reality Check:**
*   Yes, law firms are extremely document-driven and have massive lifecycle pain.
*   **BUT:** They already use specialized DMS tools (NetDocuments, iManage, Clio).
*   They are extremely risk-averse; even small firms worry about liability and malpractice.
*   Sales cycles are surprisingly long.

**Verdict:**
*   ❌ **Not a good FIRST ICP**
*   ✅ Excellent later enterprise / premium vertical

### 2️⃣ Healthcare
*   **Pain:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (Critical)
*   **Willingness to pay:** 💰💰💰💰 (High)
*   **Reachability:** ❌ Low
*   **Compliance friction:** ❌❌ Very High

**Reality Check:**
*   **HIPAA alone can kill you pre-PMF.**
*   Even clinics require BAAs, audits, and strict compliance language.
*   Google Drive is often not the system of record (EHRs are).

**Verdict:**
*   ❌ **Do not start here** (Phase-3 or never)

### 3️⃣ Finance & Financial Services
*   **Pain:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 (High)
*   **Willingness to pay:** 💰💰💰💰 (High)
*   **Reachability:** ⚠️ Medium
*   **Compliance friction:** ⚠️ Medium–High

**Reality Check:**
*   Similar to legal: high compliance expectations.
*   Often already using SharePoint, Box, or secure portals.
*   Good budgets, but harder to penetrate early without a track record.

**Verdict:**
*   ❌ **Not first**
*   ✅ Strong second vertical after proof

### 4️⃣ Accounting & Tax Services
*   **Pain:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥 (High)
*   **Willingness to pay:** 💰💰💰💰 (High)
*   **Reachability:** ✅ High
*   **Compliance friction:** ⚠️ Low–Medium

**Why this is the sweet spot:**
*   Extremely document-heavy (tax returns, statements, audits).
*   **Massive seasonal churn** (clients come and go every year).
*   Tons of Google Drive usage (especially SMB accountants).
*   Frequent client sharing + offboarding needs.
*   Less legal scrutiny than law or healthcare.
*   **Partners often make solo buying decisions.**
*   *They actively complain online about document mess.*

**Verdict:**
*   ✅ **BEST FIRST ICP**

### 5️⃣ Real Estate
*   **Pain:** 🔥🔥🔥 (Medium)
*   **Willingness to pay:** 💰💰 (Medium)
*   **Reachability:** ✅ High
*   **Fragmentation:** ❌ High

**Reality Check:**
*   Very document-heavy, but workflows are highly fragmented.
*   Many already use vertical CRMs (Dotloop, DocuSign Rooms).
*   Less recurring lifecycle management after the deal closes.

**Verdict:**
*   ❌ **Not ideal for lifecycle SaaS** (Better for transactional tools)

| Pockett Value | Accountant Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Document lifecycle** | Client record hygiene |
| **Access control** | Client confidentiality |
| **Project folders** | Client engagements |
| **Expiry / revoke** | Client offboarding |
| **Insights** | "What’s still exposed?" |

**The ROI Story:**
$50–$100/month is simply:
*   One coffee meeting with a client.
*   One saved hour per month.
*   *One avoided compliance incident.*

## Step 6: How this shapes your product

If Accounting & Tax is your first ICP, explicitly frame Pockett as:
> **"Client document lifecycle management for accounting firms using Google Drive."**

**Do NOT be:**

**Your Core Objects:**
*   Client
*   Engagement
*   Tax Year
*   Archive
