Great question. This is exactly the right **pivot-thinking moment**: not “who has documents?” but **who feels pain intensely enough to pay** for clarity, control, and professionalism on top of Google Drive.

Below is a **practical, revenue-oriented breakdown** of *which* consultants, agencies, coaches, and fractional operators are worth targeting — and *why* — with clear guidance on **who will pay**, **how much**, and **what Pockett should do for them**.

---

# The Core Pattern That Predicts Willingness to Pay

Across all successful niches below, **all 5 conditions are true**:

1. **Documents = the product or proof of value**
2. **Clients are external and rotate frequently**
3. **They already use Google Drive**
4. **They look “unprofessional” if documents are messy**
5. **One person can approve spending instantly**

If any of these are missing → poor ICP.

# 🥇 Tier 1 ICPs (Highest probability of $5K+ MRR)

## 1️⃣ Independent Consultants (Strategy, Ops, Tech, Product)

### Who exactly

* Product consultants
* Tech architecture advisors
* Digital transformation consultants
* Ops / process consultants
* Startup advisors

### Why this niche works

* Deliverables are **documents**: decks, roadmaps, analyses, reports
* Every client engagement = new Drive folder chaos
* Strong fear of **sharing the wrong doc with the wrong client**
* Often bill $150–$300/hour → $50–$100/mo SaaS is trivial

### Their pain (very real)

* “Which client still has access to my Drive?”
* “Where’s the final version?”
* “Which docs should I archive when project ends?”

### What Pockett means to them

> “A professional client workspace on top of Google Drive.”

### Willingness to pay

* **$30–$100/month**
* Often expense it as “client ops”

### Reachability

* Very high on:

  * X (ex-FAANG, startup consultants)
  * LinkedIn
  * Indie Hacker circles
  * r/consulting, r/freelance

✅ **Top recommendation**

## 2️⃣ Boutique Agencies (Design, Branding, Marketing, Dev)

### Who exactly

* Design agencies (brand, UI/UX)
* Marketing agencies
* Web development studios
* No-code / automation agencies

### Why this niche works

* Many client projects in parallel
* Many external collaborators
* Massive Google Drive usage
* Reputation-sensitive (clients notice mess)

### Their pain

* Folder sprawl across clients
* Contractors leaving without cleanup
* Clients accessing drafts months later
* “Who uploaded this? Which version is final?”

### What Pockett means to them

> “Client project control without changing tools.”

### Willingness to pay

* **$50–$150/month**
* Flat pricing beats per-seat tools

### Reachability

* Reddit: r/design, r/agency, r/webdev
* Twitter/X
* Indie agency communities
* Slack groups

⚠️ Note
Avoid competing with project managers (Asana, ClickUp).
**Position Pockett as document governance, not task management.**

---

## 3️⃣ Fractional Operators (High-value, overlooked goldmine)

### Who exactly

* Fractional CTO
* Fractional CMO
* Fractional COO
* Fractional CFO (non-regulated)

### Why this niche works

* Handle **multiple companies simultaneously**
* Each company = sensitive documents
* Cannot mix access accidentally
* Extremely risk-averse reputationally

### Their pain

* One Drive, many companies
* “Did I remove access after engagement?”
* “Which client owns this doc?”

### What Pockett means to them

> “Separation of client worlds on one Drive.”

### Willingness to pay

* **$50–$200/month**
* Expense justified as risk prevention

### Reachability

* LinkedIn
* Twitter/X
* Fractional communities
* Founder networks

✅ **Very strong ICP, under-served**

---

# 🥈 Tier 2 ICPs (Good but more nuanced)

## 4️⃣ Coaches (Executive, Career, Business)

### Who exactly

* Executive coaches
* Career coaches
* Business / leadership coaches
* High-ticket programs ($3K–$10K+)

### Why it works

* Client artifacts = docs, worksheets, plans
* Many private client folders
* Need to look polished & secure

### Where it breaks

* Many coaches use Notion
* Some are allergic to “tools”
* Lower urgency than consultants

### Willingness to pay

* **$20–$50/month**
* High volume needed

Use this as:

* A **secondary ICP**
* Or with very simple UX

---

## 5️⃣ Legal / Compliance Adjacent Freelancers (Very narrow)

### Who exactly

* Contract reviewers
* Immigration consultants
* Paralegals
* Legal ops freelancers (not law firms)

### Why it *can* work

* Strong data sensitivity
* Client document lifecycle matters
* Often still on Google Drive

### Why it’s risky

* Language must avoid “compliance”
* Trust barrier is high
* Slow conversion

Only pursue if:

* You already have traction elsewhere

# ❌ ICPs to Avoid (for now)

| ICP                    | Why                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Tax / Accounting firms | Too many incumbents, compliance-heavy |
| Law firms              | Entrenched DMS + long sales cycles    |
| Healthcare             | HIPAA nightmare                       |
| Generic SMBs           | Pain too weak                         |
| Students / creators    | Won’t pay                             |

# Recommended Focus (Clear Direction)

### 🎯 Start with **ONE ICP**

**Independent Consultants & Fractional Operators**

They give you:

* High ARPA
* Low compliance friction
* Fast decisions
* Clear Google Drive usage
* Strong word-of-mouth

### Then expand to:

* Boutique agencies
* Then coaches (if needed for volume)

---

# What Pockett Should Be for Them (Positioning)

Not:
❌ “Document workflow”
❌ “Kanban for docs”
❌ “Compliance tool”

Instead:

> **“Client document clarity on top of Google Drive.”**

Or:

> **“Never lose control of client documents again.”**

---

# How you reach $5K MRR with this ICP

Example:

* 50 consultants × $100/mo = $5K
* Or 100 × $50/mo

That is **very realistic** in the US market.
