# Query
Aren't Consulting, Advisory, Services
all essentially Agencies only?


# Response
They all sit under the broad “professional services” umbrella, but they are not exactly the same thing; “agency” is one specific way of packaging and delivering those services, especially where you act as an executing intermediary, not just an expert advisor. [1][2][3]

## What an agency is

- An **agency** is a firm of specialists that delivers ongoing, often execution-heavy services (e.g., marketing campaigns, PR, creative, media buying) for clients. [1][2]
- Agencies usually act as an **agent** or intermediary (e.g., between client and ad networks, media, or other vendors) and are measured on outputs and campaigns delivered. [1][4]

## What consulting is

- **Consulting** is providing expert analysis and recommendations to solve defined business problems, typically in project-based engagements (strategy, operations, IT, etc.). [5][3]
- Consultants are usually brought in for a **time‑bound project** with a clear scope and deliverables (diagnostics, recommendations, sometimes implementation support), rather than for continuous execution. [5][6]

## What advisory is

- **Advisory** focuses on long‑term, ongoing guidance: helping clients manage risk, plan strategy, and make decisions over time rather than solving just a single project problem. [7][8][5]
- Advisory relationships are often **retainer‑style**, recurring, and closer to being a “trusted partner” than a project vendor, common in tax, risk, compliance, and financial planning. [8][5]

## How they relate

- All three are **service businesses** selling expertise and time, so in that sense, yes, they are “agency-like” compared to product or SaaS businesses. [1][9]
- The practical distinction is in **engagement model**:  
  - Agency → execution and deliverables, often volume/retainer based. [2][10]
  - Consulting → project-based problem solving and recommendations, sometimes with implementation. [5][3]
  - Advisory → ongoing guidance and decision support, often in specialized domains (tax, risk, corporate finance). [7][8]

## For your positioning

- A one‑person or small firm doing GRC/infosec can accurately call itself **consulting**, **advisory**, or a **boutique agency**, but the label signals how you work:  
  - Use “consulting” for projects (gap assessments, implementations). [11][3]
  - Use “advisory” for long‑term vCISO / vDPO / board-level guidance. [7][8]
  - Use “agency” if you also run ongoing, execution-heavy functions (e.g., operating a managed security desk, continuous privacy ops like DSAR handling, etc.). [1][2]
