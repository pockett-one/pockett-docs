Folder-based permission models feel natural because they mirror physical filing systems. Put something in a folder, control the folder, and you're done. That mental model works in stable environments.

Client work is not stable.

## Why inheritance becomes dangerous

Folder permissions rely heavily on inheritance. Share a parent folder, and everything beneath it becomes accessible. That's convenient—until files move, teams change, and projects end.

Inheritance assumes permanence. Client work is fluid.

Over time, access spreads invisibly. Subfolders inherit permissions that were never explicitly reviewed. People gain access without clear intent.

## The confidence problem

The most damaging outcome isn't a breach. It's doubt.

When teams cannot confidently explain who has access to what, they hesitate to make strong guarantees to clients. That hesitation erodes trust quietly but consistently.

## Why audits fail to solve this

Audits tell you who has access today. They don't tell you why that access exists or whether it still makes sense. Manual audits are also expensive and error-prone.

## A better access model

Better systems treat access as something that must be earned, reviewed, and revoked automatically. Projects—not folders—become the unit of access.

## When this is not a fit

If your environment is static with stable teams and minimal external access, folder-based permissions may still be sufficient.
