# Clinked vs Pockett: Which Client Portal Is Better for Small Teams?

If you're evaluating client portal software, Clinked has probably caught your attention. It's a mature product with years of development behind it, built with a strong focus on secure collaboration and enterprise-grade features. But here's the thing: depending on your team size and actual workflow, all that sophistication might feel heavier than necessary.

This comparison breaks down **Clinked vs Pockett** so you can decide which tool fits your reality, not someone else's ideal.

## Who This Comparison Is For

This guide is written for consultants and agencies who need to share files, updates, and feedback with clients without turning collaboration into a complex project. If you're a small service team looking to replace the chaos of Google Drive folders and endless email threads, this comparison will help you understand which platform aligns with your needs.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Clinked | Pockett |
|------|--------|---------|
| Client portal | Yes | Yes |
| File sharing | Yes | Yes |
| Branding | Yes | Yes |
| Workflow complexity | High | Low |
| Setup time | Longer | Fast |
| Learning curve | Moderate | Minimal |

## When Clinked Makes Sense

Clinked shines when you need granular control over every aspect of collaboration. If you operate in compliance-heavy environments where you need detailed audit trails and sophisticated permission structures, Clinked's depth becomes an asset rather than overhead. It's also ideal if you want advanced internal workflows built directly into the portal, allowing your team to manage projects, tasks, and communications all in one place.

The tradeoff? You'll invest more time in setup and configuration. Your clients will need some guidance to navigate the platform effectively. But if control and compliance are non-negotiable, these tradeoffs are worth it.

## When Pockett Makes Sense

Pockett is built for teams that want clients to "just get it" without training sessions or lengthy explanations. If your team prefers clarity over configuration and you're primarily looking to replace Drive folders and email chaos with something more structured, Pockett's simplicity becomes its superpower.

The platform recognizes that most small teams don't need enterprise-grade complexity. Instead, it focuses on making file sharing, feedback, and updates feel natural and intuitive. Your clients figure it out quickly because there's less to figure out.

## The Real Difference

Here's the fundamental distinction: Clinked optimizes for **control**. It gives you extensive configuration options, detailed permissions, and comprehensive workflows. Pockett optimizes for **simplicity**. It provides structure without ceremony, clarity without complexity.

The best choice depends on how much complexity you want to manage versus how much you want the tool to fade into the background. If you need extensive control and don't mind the setup overhead, Clinked is the right choice. If you want something that just works without becoming a project itself, Pockett fits better.

## Final Thoughts

Client portals should reduce friction, not introduce it. The right tool is the one your team and clients actually enjoy using — the one that supports your work rather than becoming work itself. Consider your actual needs, not your aspirational ones, and choose accordingly.
