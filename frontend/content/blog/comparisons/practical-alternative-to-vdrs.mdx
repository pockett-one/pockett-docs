There is a wide gap between casually sharing a Drive folder and deploying a full Virtual Data Room. That gap is where most real client work lives.

## The missing middle

Non-transactional work needs:
- Familiar tools
- Clear boundaries
- Automatic cleanup
- Minimal ceremony

It doesn't need weeks of setup or rigid approval flows.

## Why behavior matters more than features

When systems rely on perfect human behavior, they eventually fail. People forget to revoke access. They share drafts informally. They bypass friction.

Better tools don't demand discipline—they reduce the cost of mistakes.

## What a practical alternative looks like

A practical alternative treats projects as the unit of work. Access is granted intentionally, reviewed regularly, and revoked automatically when work ends. Familiar storage systems remain in place, but structure is added around them.

## When this is not a fit

If your work involves formal transactions, audits, or regulatory scrutiny, a full VDR may still be required.
