Google Drive is one of the most successful collaboration products ever built. It's fast, familiar, and flexible—especially for internal teams. Files sync quickly, sharing links is effortless, and almost everyone already knows how to use it. That familiarity makes Drive feel like the safest possible default.

The problems don't appear immediately. They surface slowly, once client-facing work enters the picture.

## Where Drive starts to struggle

The first shared folder with a client feels like a win. No onboarding. No training. No friction. But client work isn't internal collaboration with a different email address. It has different constraints: different trust boundaries, different lifecycles, and different expectations around visibility.

Google Drive assumes sameness. Client work demands separation.

Over time, subtle issues accumulate. Permissions get reused from old projects. Folder structures become deep and inconsistent. Subfolders inherit access unintentionally. Months later, teams can't confidently answer who still has access—and why.

## The real issue: no project lifecycle

The deeper issue isn't usability or even security. It's that Google Drive has no concept of project lifecycle. Files persist indefinitely unless a human remembers to clean things up. Client engagements, however, have clear beginnings and endings. Access should follow that lifecycle automatically.

When it doesn't, risk grows quietly.

## The long-term cost of "good enough"

Every workaround adds cognitive load. Every reused folder adds uncertainty. Eventually, teams stop trusting their own system—not because files are missing, but because confidence is.

Client portals are not about storage. They are about clarity over time.

## When Google Drive is actually fine

Google Drive remains an excellent tool when:
- Everyone involved is internal
- Work is short-lived or low risk
- Structure is informal

The mistake isn't using Drive. It's expecting it to solve a problem it was never designed to handle.

## When this is not a fit

If your work is strictly internal or ad hoc, introducing additional structure may slow you down unnecessarily. Drive alone may be perfectly sufficient.
