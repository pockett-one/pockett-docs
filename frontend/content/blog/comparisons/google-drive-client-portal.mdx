# Google Drive as a Client Portal: Where It Breaks and What to Use Instead

Google Drive is often the default choice for sharing files with clients, and for good reason. It's familiar, accessible, and free. For small projects and one-off file sharing, Drive works perfectly fine. When you're collaborating internally or sharing a few documents occasionally, there's no need to overcomplicate things.

But here's what happens as your workflow grows: Drive starts showing its limitations, and those limitations become daily frustrations.

## Where Drive Actually Works

Drive excels in simple scenarios. Small projects with minimal file sharing don't need complex structure. One-off file sharing where you send a document once and move on works perfectly. Internal collaboration where everyone understands your folder structure and naming conventions functions smoothly.

The problem isn't Drive itself — it's that Drive wasn't designed to be a client portal. It's a file storage system that happens to allow sharing, not a collaboration platform built for client relationships.

## Where Drive Breaks Down

As your client work becomes more complex, Drive's limitations become painful. Permission sprawl means you're constantly resharing links when access expires or gets lost. Folder chaos emerges as projects multiply and you struggle to remember which folder belongs to which client. Most critically, there's no feedback loop — clients email you thoughts that get buried in your inbox, and you have no visibility into what they've reviewed or when.

Perhaps most frustrating is the lack of accountability. You can't see who accessed what document or when. You can't track feedback or ensure clients have reviewed deliverables. You're operating blind, hoping everything works out.

## What a Dedicated Client Portal Actually Provides

A dedicated client portal solves these problems by design. Structured access means clients always know where to find their documents without asking you. Clear ownership makes it obvious who's responsible for what. Feedback visibility ensures nothing gets lost — you can see what clients have reviewed and when they provided input. Most importantly, it creates a better client experience that reflects your professionalism.

## Recognizing When It's Time to Switch

If you find yourself constantly resharing links because clients can't find documents, fixing permissions because access keeps breaking, or chasing feedback because it disappears into email threads, it's time to move on. These aren't minor inconveniences — they're signs that your current system isn't scaling with your business.

The right client portal doesn't just store files — it creates structure, enables collaboration, and builds trust. When Drive becomes a bottleneck instead of a solution, that's when you know it's time for something built specifically for client collaboration.
