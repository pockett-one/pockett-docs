"Client-friendly" is one of the most overused phrases in software marketing. It's usually equated with clean UI, modern design, or fewer buttons.

That's not what clients care about.

## What clients actually want

Clients want:
- To not learn a new system
- To not remember where things live
- To not worry about doing something wrong

They are here for outcomes, not tools.

## Familiarity beats novelty

This is why email persists. Why Google Docs dominates. Familiar tools reduce friction—even when they're imperfect.

The best client-facing software wraps structure around familiar behavior instead of demanding change.

## When this is not a fit

If your users are trained operators or internal teams, more complex systems may be acceptable.
