# Getting Started with Pockett Docs

Welcome to Pockett Docs! This guide will help you transform your Google Drive into a professional client portal that impresses clients and eliminates the chaos of raw Drive links.

## What is Pockett Docs?

Pockett Docs is a client portal platform built on top of your existing Google Drive. Instead of sending clients generic "Untitled Folder" links, you deliver a branded, professional portal that reflects your expertise. Your files stay in Google Drive—no migration needed. Your team keeps using Drive. Clients see a polished experience.

## Key Features

### Professional Client Portal
Replace unprofessional Drive links with a branded portal that impresses clients. No more "Untitled Folder" links that damage your reputation.

### Protect Sensitive Files
Prevent IP theft with self-destruct timers, "Never Share" tags, and persona-based access control that automatically separates what clients see versus internal files.

### Automatic Permission Management
Stop wasting time resharing links or fixing permissions. Access stays active, and clients always know where to find documents. No more "can you resend that link?" emails.

### Structured Organization
Turn messy Drive folders into a clean Client → Project hierarchy that makes sense to clients. Uses your existing Google Drive structure—no migration needed.

### Track Client Engagement
See exactly what clients have reviewed, when they accessed documents, and track feedback that stays organized and visible. No more chasing clients for input.

### Works with Your Existing Google Drive
No learning curve. Built on top of Google Drive—your files stay where they are. No migration, no relearning. Your team keeps using Drive, clients see a professional portal.

### One-Click Access Revocation
Lock projects when done. One-click project closure automatically revokes all Drive permissions. Lock client folders to "View Only" when deliverables are finalized.

### Document Access Tracking
Eliminate version confusion. See who accessed what document and when. Track document changes and ensure clients see the right versions.

### Simplified Access Control
Assign team members to one of four simple personas (Project Lead, Team Member, External Collaborator, Client Contact). Persona determines access automatically—no granular file-by-file permission headaches.

### Organized Feedback
Comments and feedback on documents that stay organized, visible, and tied to the document. Never lose track of client input again.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Sign Up
Join the waitlist to get early access to Pockett Docs.

### Step 2: Connect Your Google Drive
Link your Google Drive account. Pockett Docs works with your existing files—no migration needed. Your files stay exactly where they are.

### Step 3: Create Your First Project
Set up a project for a client engagement. Choose from the Client → Project hierarchy structure that makes sense to both you and your clients.

### Step 4: Assign Personas
Add team members and assign them to personas:
- **Project Lead**: Full access to manage the project
- **Team Member**: Access to project files
- **External Collaborator**: Limited access for contractors
- **Client Contact**: Client-facing access with appropriate restrictions

### Step 5: Share the Professional Portal
Instead of sending raw Drive links, share your branded client portal. Clients see a polished experience that reflects your professionalism.

### Step 6: Track Engagement
Monitor what clients have reviewed, when they accessed documents, and track feedback that stays organized and visible.

### Step 7: Lock Projects When Done
When deliverables are finalized, one-click project closure automatically revokes permissions and locks folders to "View Only" for clean project handoffs.

## Best Practices

- **Start with One Project**: Begin with a single client engagement to familiarize yourself with the workflow
- **Use Personas Consistently**: Assign personas based on role, not individual permissions
- **Protect Sensitive Files**: Use "Never Share" tags for internal frameworks and sensitive IP
- **Track Client Engagement**: Regularly check what clients have reviewed to stay ahead of feedback needs
- **Lock Projects Promptly**: Close projects when deliverables are finalized to maintain clean access control
