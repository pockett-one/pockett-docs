# Why We Built Pockett

Pockett started with a simple frustration that many consultants and agencies know all too well.

## The Problem We Lived With

Picture this scenario: You're working with multiple clients, each needing access to different documents, each providing feedback through different channels. Files are scattered across Google Drive folders, Dropbox links, email attachments, and Slack messages. Important feedback gets buried in email threads. Clients can't find what they're looking for, and you spend more time hunting for files than actually doing the work.

This chaos wasn't just annoying — it was eroding trust. Clients felt confused about where to find their documents. Teams felt overwhelmed trying to keep everything organized. Everyone was working harder, not smarter.

## What We Actually Needed

We realized that what we really needed was simple: one clear space per client where everything lived. A place where clients could find documents without asking, provide feedback without email threads, and see updates without confusion. Most importantly, we needed something that required no training — something so intuitive that clients would figure it out naturally.

We wanted structure without ceremony. We wanted organization without complexity. We wanted a tool that supported our work instead of becoming work itself.

## The Philosophy That Guides Us

This experience taught us something fundamental: software should support work, not become work. Too many tools promise to solve problems but end up creating new ones. They require extensive setup, constant maintenance, and ongoing training. They optimize for features instead of outcomes.

We built Pockett on a different principle: clarity, trust, and momentum. When teams and clients can collaborate smoothly, trust builds naturally. When information flows clearly, momentum accelerates. When tools fade into the background, work becomes the focus.

## Where We're Going

Pockett isn't just about file sharing or client portals. It's about fixing the fundamental disconnect between how teams want to work and how tools force them to work. We're building toward a future where client collaboration feels natural, where structure supports rather than constrains, and where software serves people instead of the other way around.

Every feature we add, every decision we make, comes back to this question: Does this help teams and clients work better together? If the answer isn't a clear yes, we don't build it. That's the promise we made to ourselves, and it's the promise we're keeping with every client who trusts us with their collaboration.
