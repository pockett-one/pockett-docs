Most client portals look great in demos. Setup is smooth. Early usage feels organized. The problems don't show up until later.

## The decay phase

After the first few weeks, habits form. Clients log in less often. Teams revert to email. The portal still exists, but it's no longer the source of truth.

Nothing breaks loudly. Everything just erodes.

## Why this happens

Most portals are designed around onboarding moments, not ongoing work. They assume ideal user behavior and consistent engagement.

Real work is messier.

## What sustains long-running engagement

Tools that survive long-term adapt to human behavior. They reduce friction instead of enforcing discipline. They feel familiar, not instructional.
