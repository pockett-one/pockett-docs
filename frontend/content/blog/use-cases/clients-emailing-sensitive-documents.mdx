Email persists because it is universal. Everyone has it. Everyone knows how to use it. That convenience makes it the default channel for sharing sensitive documents.

## The hidden damage of attachments

Every attachment creates a new copy. That copy lives forever in inboxes you don't control. There is no single source of truth, no clear audit trail, and no way to revoke access.

As documents evolve, confusion compounds. Teams waste time reconciling versions. Clients respond to outdated files. Sensitive information spreads further than intended.

## Email's proper role

Email should notify, not store. Its job is to point people to a shared source of truth—not to become one itself.
