Most data leaks don't look like breaches. There are no alarms, no ransom notes, and no urgent calls from IT. Instead, they happen quietly, over time, through ordinary behaviors that feel harmless in the moment.

This is especially true in consulting and professional services.

## The quiet leak pattern

A typical scenario looks like this: a project wraps up, the final deliverables are sent, and everyone moves on to the next engagement. The folder used for that work remains exactly where it is. Permissions stay intact. No one feels urgency to clean up because nothing appears broken.

Weeks or months later, sensitive documents are still accessible to people who no longer have a reason to see them.

No one intended this. That's the problem.

## Why consultants are uniquely exposed

Consultants work across many clients, often in parallel. To save time, they reuse folder structures, templates, and access settings. What starts as efficiency gradually turns into exposure.

Because access is rarely tied to intent, it persists long after the work ends.

## Why audits aren't enough

Periodic permission audits help, but they are reactive. They answer who has access today, not who should have access at all. They also rely heavily on manual review, which doesn't scale.

True prevention requires automation.

Access should end because work ended—not because someone remembered to clean up.

## When this is not a fit

If your work is strictly internal and short-lived, permission drift may be less risky. In long-running client work, it compounds quickly.
