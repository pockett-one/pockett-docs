Fractional CXOs live in constant context switching. Different clients. Different expectations. Different sensitivities. What they rarely have is time to manage complex systems.

## The common mistake

Many fractional leaders reuse the same document setup across clients. It feels efficient, but it quietly introduces risk. Files blur together. Permissions linger longer than they should.

## A simple structure that works

The most effective workflow is simple:
- One workspace per client
- One project per engagement
- Clear roles
- Automatic access removal

Clients may never comment on the system directly, but they feel the difference. Clarity builds confidence.

## When this is not a fit

If you only work with a single client or engagement at a time, simpler setups may be sufficient.
