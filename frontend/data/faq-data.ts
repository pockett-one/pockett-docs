    question: `How does ${BRAND_NAME} connect to my Google Drive?`,
    answer: `${BRAND_NAME} uses secure OAuth 2.0 authentication to act as a management layer on top of your existing Google Drive. We assume a 'Non-Custodial' design, meaning your files effectively never leave your Google Drive. We simply organize them into professional Client Portals and manage sharing permissions.`,

    question: `What exactly does ${BRAND_NAME} do for consultants and marketing teams?`,
    answer: `${BRAND_NAME} turns your messy Google Drive folders into a secure, branded Client Portal. Marketing agencies, fractional executives, and advisory firms use it to package campaign and strategy deliverables professionally, track who accesses your Intellectual Property, and—most importantly—instantly revoke access ('Wrap') when an engagement ends to prevent 'Zombie Links'.`,

    question: "Is my data secure? Do you store my files?",
    answer: "Your security is our priority. Because we use a Non-Custodial architecture, we do not store your actual file contents on our servers—they remain encrypted in your Google Drive. We only store the metadata needed to power your dashboard, audit logs, and engagement hierarchy.",

    question: `What happens if I stop using ${BRAND_NAME}?`,
    answer: `Nothing happens to your files. Since ${BRAND_NAME} organizes the data that already lives in your Google Drive, you retain full ownership. If you cancel, your folders and files remain exactly where they are in Drive—you just lose the professional Portal view and automated access controls.`,

    question: "Can I manage access for multiple clients?",
    answer: `Yes. ${BRAND_NAME} is designed for firm-level scale. You can create distinct Engagements for each client, map specific Drive folders to them, and manage permissions granularly. Our 'Audit Log' shows you exactly which external domains (clients) have access to which files.`,

    question: `Is ${BRAND_NAME} a good fit for marketing agencies and fractional marketing leaders?`,
    answer: `Yes. ${BRAND_NAME} is built for teams that juggle many clients and recurring deliverables—retainers, campaigns, and approvals—without migrating files off Google Drive. You get one branded portal per client engagement, clear access boundaries, and Wrap when the relationship ends.`,

  {
    question: `How does ${BRAND_NAME} help with campaign assets, approvals, and retainers if we keep files in Google Drive?`,
    answer: `${BRAND_NAME} does not duplicate your creative files—it maps your existing Drive folders into client-facing portals. Clients see a professional, on-brand experience while your team keeps working in Drive. Engagements align to how you bill (projects or retainers), and you can see who accessed what in the Audit Log.`,

    question: `Why use ${BRAND_NAME} instead of email and ad-hoc Google Drive links for agency clients?`,
    answer: `Email and one-off Drive links scatter versions, hide who saw what, and leave “zombie links” active after a project wraps. ${BRAND_NAME} centralizes access per engagement, preserves an audit trail, and lets you revoke access in one step with Wrap—so campaign and strategy IP does not leak after the engagement ends.`,

  {
    question: `Can a strategic consultant or advisory partner use ${BRAND_NAME} for long-term client relationships?`,
    answer: `Yes. Advisory and consulting engagements map cleanly to Engagements in ${BRAND_NAME}: ongoing strategy work, board-ready packs, and shared folders stay organized under one portal per client. When an advisory mandate concludes, Wrap removes client access without deleting your Drive files.`,

    question: `Does ${BRAND_NAME} work for multiple marketing clients at the same time?`,
    answer: `Yes. Create a separate Engagement for each client, map the right Drive folders, and manage permissions per relationship. The Audit Log shows which external domains touched which files—ideal for agencies and fractional leaders running parallel accounts.`,
